(22, 'October-09-2022 20:37:51', 'What Moves God: Need Or Faith?', 'Faith', 'Fayiah S. Tamba', 'Need_or_Faith.jpg', 'The silence of God to seemingly discouraged and disappointed Christians raises a theological question regarding whether or not God responds by needs or faith to people experiencing suffering in a complex, sinful and dying world.\r\n\r\nThree (3) years ago, many reputable, lovely, and potential people died during the rapid spread and effect of the deadly global pandemic (COVID-19). Old and young, black and white races are affected. In fact, the death rate escalated daily, thus leaving economies to crumble, families to starve, the employment rate to decrease, as well as, Christian worship to be restricted.\r\n\r\nPhilip Yancey, an American theologian, writes (2010), \"Where is God When It Hurts?\" He attempts to ascertain reasons for the silence of God and examine the level of God\'s intervention in the world and dealings with people who are experiencing suffering from war, drought, constant prosecution, economic constraints, etc. Yancey (2010)\'s question is a needed challenge to investigate what moves God to answer prayer – need or faith?\r\n\r\nIn response, an African writer named Thompson J. Washington, from his book (2011), The Faith Factor, complements Yancey\'s question and argues that \"God will not meet you at the point of your needs but the point of your faith.\"\r\n\r\nNowadays, many African Christians believe that \"God moves at the point of our needs.\" Their misconception of Philippians 4:19, \"But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus\" has generated this claim. Contrarily, those who believe that God moves based on faith tend to agree with Hebrews 11:6, \"But without faith, it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarded of them that diligently seek him.\"\r\n\r\nIn light of this theological contention, Christians must resolve that God moves to meet needs in response to faith. Philippians 4:19 simply teaches that God possesses heavenly blessings and has already enriched his people (Ephesians 1:3). However, Paul did not disclose any prerequisite to accessing the blessings that will meet all needs of humanity except in Hebrews 11:6 where Christians are given the assurance of being rewarded with material and spiritual blessings.\r\n\r\nWashington (2011) believes that faith is a means by which God responds miraculously, as recorded in Biblical History. Faith is a human response to get God\'s attention. And if everything seems lost, all is not lost because faith in God can change a story incredibly!\r\n\r\nA classic example is the story of Abram, whose name changed to Abraham (Genesis 15:6). He needed a son to continue his lineage and subsequently fulfill the promise of becoming the father of many nations. God recognized his need but could only act based on the level of Abraham\'s faith. Blessedly, God accounted his faith for righteousness (v.6) and met his needs.\r\n\r\nWhen Liberia recorded her first Covid-19 case in March and April 2020, Liberians everywhere prayed and pleaded with God for their recovery. They fasted for days and exercised their faith for victims, realizing that healing comes from God through doctors (Acts 12:5). And affected people miraculously recovered to the astonishment of people but to the glory of God.\r\n\r\nFaith is the opposite of fear and it permits God to act. Fear creates doubts and unbelief. Faith was a requirement for salvation, healing, deliverance, and miracles during Jesus\' ministry. Many who came to Jesus had some level of faith, which caused them healed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Christians should trust the healing power of God and acknowledge Him as the Master healer. Paul reminds the Christians, \"For we walk by faith, not by sight\" (2 Corinthians 5:7). Even if Christians should cry out to God (Exodus 3:7), it should be done in faith, not as if they are complaining about their situation. God knows your need, yet he is moved by your faith.'),
(23, 'October-10-2022 16:35:07', 'Fathers, Take Up Your Responsibility!', 'Family Life', 'Fayiah S. Tamba', 'father-take-responsibility.jpg', 'Things are steadily changing about parental role and responsibility in the home. Since 2007 the world first experienced its dreadful economic crisis, most families had been struggling to upkeep their homes. \r\n\r\nIn Liberia, many children are vulnerably roaming the streets of Monrovia because their fathers cannot assume their domestic responsibilities. Some fathers are liabilities to their families, thereby allowing their wives and children to become the breadwinners of the home. Mothers are searching for full-time jobs and even taking on part-time jobs to help support their homes. However, they do not have much time to monitor the upbringing of the children because of the hustles to upkeep the family. \r\n\r\nYears ago, I listened to a radio interview held with Liberian children at various gambling centers, where children explained why they chose to gamble. A child said, “We are in the street gambling because our fathers do not have saving accounts for us.” His response was touching but heartbreaking! \r\n\r\nAlthough the world is evolving, and mothers are securing job opportunities to help upkeep the financial status of the home, God never intended the mothers to be the sole breadwinners of the family. The book of Genesis reveals that God placed Adam in authority to look after the garden, as a father ought to care for his family. He was the breadwinner for his wife. God could not expect Adam to depend on his wife for provision. Instead, God was Adam\'s Provider. \r\n\r\nDesignated as the helpmeet by God, mothers are to get involved in bringing up the children and make significant contributions to upkeep the home. Fathers are the heads and therefore must provide for their homes. \r\n\r\nChildren are sensitive to whether their fathers can address their basic needs. The failure of a father to financially upkeep his home might cause his child/children to disrespect him or shift blame, like the child who justified his notorious behavior because of his father’s inability to give him a better life. He probably felt that his father was incapable of addressing his needs. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, David G. Burkholder, in the book \"Ye Father\" asserted that one of the main factors contributing to poverty in Africa is that fathers have refused to take up responsibility. He emphasized that the definition of a father has been limited to someone who only brings forth children into the world. Beyond this meaning, he further encouraged fathers to care for the welfare of their wives and children. \r\n\r\nIn light of this observation, I would like to suggest ways fathers can take up responsibility in their homes:\r\n\r\n1.	Find something to do with your hands.\r\nBefore God presented Eve to Adam as his wife, Adam had a job that assumed a responsibility “to dress and to keep the garden” (Genesis 2:15). Adam could not have easily survived in the garden if he had not cultivated it well to produce good harvests. Always have something for sustainability before engaging in marriage. If a man is already married without having a job, it is better and safe for him as a father to go out and find a job that will sustain his family. \r\n\r\n2.	Handle the finances wisely to sustain the family\r\nFathers are to use resources wisely to support their families. Whatever goes to the home through the father belongs to the family! I am obliged to say this because I have observed that not all irresponsible fathers are jobless. Some fathers have lucrative jobs but are cruel to their families. They do not prioritize the needs of their families. And their children would resolve to gamble and beg to survive while their wives are being traumatized by carrying the burden of the home. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, fathers must assume responsibility in their homes and be blessings to many around them. They must be assets, not liabilities to their wives and children. '),
(24, 'October-10-2022 16:55:17', 'The Need For Adequate Public Latrines in Liberia', 'Public Health', 'Fayiah S. Tamba', 'public-latrines.jpg', 'Statistical analyses of credible institutions based on observation and surveys suggest that Liberia is accumulating rapid population growth. However, political critics believe that growth without development is a challenge to Liberia\'s stability (Clower, 1966). The Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services (LISGIS, 2008) reported that Liberia\'s population was 3,489,072, and the World Population Review estimated 5.06 million (WPR, 2021). Meanwhile, LISGIS is conducting the Geography Planning Survey (GPS) to update the population status of Liberia.\r\n\r\nJMP (2017) revealed that less than 20% of Liberia\'s population lacked access to private toilet facilities, while 42% of Liberia\'s population practiced open defecation. Recently, Amb. Bobby Whitfield, the Executive Director of Liberia National Sanitation and Hygiene Commission (WASH), reported that 47% of Liberia\'s population lack access to privately owned latrines (Peters & Parley, 2021). These results show that Liberia\'s population with no privately owned latrines has increased. \r\n\r\nThe Government of Liberia and its development partners have been committed to ensuring environmental health and sustainability by implementing a series of measures toward achieving the MDGs (#7) and SDGs (#6). But unresolved public health issues are confronting the health sector, with which lack of adequate public toilets is paramount. There is a limited contribution to constructing on-street public latrines that should solve the problem of open defecation in Liberia. Liberia has fewer on-street toilets with high service fees to accommodate travelers and passers-by. These privately-owned public latrines are built with makeshift structures, mud, and concrete blocks, and have limited rooms that hardly accommodate 3-5 people at once. \r\n\r\nAccording to All Africa Liberia (December 2018), Liberia had lost 17. 5 million US Dollars annually due to poor sanitation as citizens are being affected by waterborne diseases and infections. I suppose that low budgetary support and overpopulation are the causes of this problem. The expenditure claimed a high budgetary allocation and depleted Government savings because the Liberian Government seems to spend more on curative health than preventive care. \r\n\r\nThose who usually do not have privately owned latrines use buckets as toilets and empty them at night. This problem threatens and compromises public health, particularly residents of slum communities, of which women and girls are mostly affected by chronic infections. Many Liberians cannot even access the limited existing toilet facilities constructed in communities. They would prefer using the on-street public toilet facilities, as long as they are clean and spacious. Thus, health development is needed to prevent Liberians from contracting diseases and infections that are likely to diminish their health.\r\n\r\nThe provision of public latrines is a significant aspect of ensuring environmental sustainability and achieving Sustainable Development Goals #3 (Good Health and Well-being) and #6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Increasing the number of public toilets implements a sustainable sanitation program across Liberia and creates a healthy environment. To mitigate the threat to a healthy environment posed by inadequate public toilet facilities across Liberia, the following strategies should be implemented:\r\n\r\n1.	Increase the number of public toilets in slum communities and other former settlements to prevent waterborne diseases and infections and eradicate open defecation.\r\n2.	Prioritize the need for budgetary support to step up its intervention by increasing access to public toilet facilities across the country.\r\n3.	Collaborate with private managers or NGOs to construct on-street toilet facilities.\r\n4.	Create a maintenance team to manage the operation and usage of the public toilet facilities to ensure environmental sustainability and prevent users from waterborne diseases and infections.\r\n5.	Plant a signpost at intersections or on the roadsides to help travelers find the public toilets. Place the signpost blocks or meters away from the facility to direct travelers and passersby to the public toilet.\r\n\r\nI, therefore, challenge the Government of Liberia and private investors to take advantage of constructing on-street public toilets to ease the burden on Liberians. But if the Government of Liberia claimed to have limited resources to prioritize this project, it is advantageous for interested business individuals to study the case and remedy the situation.\r\n'),

There was not much to accomplish due to the effect of coronavirus. Those who survived the severity of the virus must be grateful to God Almighty that 2022 affords them another opportunity to recover what they had lost to Covid-19. 2022 is a year of refreshing opportunities? Embrace it with a focused mind. \r\n\r\nDon\'t settle for less despite the challenges of life. Nothing in life is worth deserving without fighting for. Engage your dream, ambition, and vision and become a legend in your dispensation. You are transitioning from discovery to recovery, which illustrates the principle of seeking and finding. Discover your true identity, and stop trying to become someone or something you are not. Otherwise, you may never see the good in yourself. Unless you discover, you won’t recover! John Mason wrote a book, entitle, \"Imitation is Limitation\". See the best in yourself!\r\n\r\nMay I illustrate \'discover to recover\' by describing the functionalities of a computer Recycle Bin. We can draw from its dual operations – delete & recover – to teach a practical life lesson. As a computer end-user, I would mistakenly and initially delete a file and thought I had lost it forever. As my computer knowledge increased, I learned how to recover deleted files to the original directory. Sometimes, I may choose to delete the files finally from my computer memory. This example teaches that there’s hope for recovery.\r\n\r\nSee yourself as the best in your generation. Your failure to discover yourself could make it impossible if not difficult to recover from situations imposing stagnation, suppression, joblessness, poverty, poor health condition, non-achievements, etc. Based on your knowledge of the previous year’s challenges, primarily concentrate on the most important things you wish to do. Be strategic in advancing your plans for 2022.\r\n\r\nLife is not a competition but a contribution. Never be intimated by the progress and achievements of your peers or superiors. Be inspired and work hard to make your contributions. Never subject yourself to envying others. Arise to your potential! You know yourself better than anybody else. Don’t allow situation condition you to a place. Step forward and aim at your dreams and visions. Discover who you want to become in life and how you would like to contribute to society. You have the power to add value to yourself by improving in areas of limitations and becoming creative and innovative.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, Cemenco, a cement company in my country hired me as a nightshift contractor. I worked in a division/department called “Recycle.\" Today I guess it still exists! My team and I were obligated to repackage burst cement bags. Once there was a scarcity of cement in the Liberian market, the Management would hire women to sweep the entire compound, pile, and collect the cement dust from the ground for repackaging.\r\n\r\nWe would pour the cement dust into a certain kind of machine and refill new cement bags. That was a recovery in action! Management could not afford to lose their valuable materials. They discovered higher production increase sales, generate revenues, and reduce scarcity in the market. Similarly, you should add value to yourself and be marketable in your dispensation. It\'s time to discover and recover!\r\n\r\nDespite your limitations, count on God to establish you. You are destined for greatness. Far beyond what men can imagine, God sees the best in you. Life is worth living when you can discover who you are and where you are going. '),

Almost all the celebrants we admire today had small beginnings. They didn’t reach the top overnight. Opportunities surrounded them from the little things they were committed to doing daily.\r\n\r\nThe road to success could be extremely difficult for those who want to get there quickly and easily but possible for people who are ready and willing to go through the required processes. Make sure to wisely use every opportunity available to you. Managing your small beginning now predicts how well you will handle bigger opportunities. All your wishes in life may not be fulfilled at once until you tackle them bit by bit.\r\n\r\nEmbrace the little things you are doing. They are bridges to cross you to an expected end. Even if nobody commends you, keep pushing and know that your labor is not in vain. At the appropriate time, God will use that little thing to announce you and people will be compelled to commend you on your success. Remember whatever you are doing now that seems little is the beginning of greatness. Don\'t despise your small beginning!\r\n\r\nBefore a tree grows bigger to bear flowers and fruits and be admired and fed upon, it must be first planted into the ground as a seed and after a while germinate to cause attraction and make provision. Similarly, your present condition is likened to this seed and you have to be patient to undergo the process of germination. As you climb the ladder to greatness, know that little is much when God is in it. It’s not how long you’ve been doing the same thing but how well.\r\n\r\nExpect an incredible result when you embrace your small beginning. Life is such that we have to experience small things before we see big things. Whether you are starting a new job that cannot fully sustain you or selling a type of product you are ashamed of, don\'t quit. You are almost to your breakthrough. Hold on to your current position until bigger opportunity is available to you.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, many Liberian women and girls were ashamed to sell on the streets. They depended on men for everything. Today, things have changed. I see potential and beautiful girls are selling cold water, sugar cane, cookies, and plastic bags on the streets of Monrovia.\r\n\r\nAlways be at your best at your small beginning. Few years ago, I didn’t despise my small beginnings. I sold on the streets, between cars, in video clubs, and other places. I was not ashamed of selling the least items because I had to assist my parents with provision in the home. At that time, women laughed at me, and called me all sort of names because I was carrying waiter on my head and holding bucket in my hand. I didn\'t care about their mockery. I was focused and pleased to help alleviate poverty from my family.\r\n\r\nHowbeit, I understood that the Liberian slogan “small, small” reinforces our courage and commitment to push forward in life regardless of our ups and downs. We should focus on doing the small things now and expect big things later.'),

Tamba', 'education-grading.jpg', 'Students are being misguided into concentrating most on scoring grades or acquiring honorable degrees instead of seeking to acquire the requisite knowledge needed for societal change.\r\n\r\nFrom high school to college days, I have seen and sat with students who will do everything to acquire good grades but less, or if possible, nothing to understand the subject matter so they would replicate knowledge. What a sad time we are observing in the Liberia educational system!\r\n\r\nWorse of all, parents tend to be supportive by coercing teachers to manufacture good grades for their children so that others will be proud of them. This disservice is alarming and rampant in Liberia, as well as in other countries.\r\n\r\nObtaining unearned grades is a complete deception to the students and a manipulation of the educational system. Indeed, this is what I term \'barrier to learning. Honest grades are preferable to acquiring dishonest grades.\r\n\r\nIronically, it is becoming more evident that most students who had earned grades and degrees did not learn anything. After graduation, the world or society they live in is not impacted. They claim to have walked out of the walls of their educational institutions but never allowed the walls to pass through them. How pathetic and devastating their lives may be!\r\n\r\nStudents who may seem to concentrate on acquiring dishonest grades may have the highest grades or honorable degrees today. However, tomorrow they could be confronted with a life situation that will cause them to justify how much they have learned to deserve such a grading reward.\r\n\r\nMy experience, being a student and teacher has taught me that students\' most significant motivation for learning is acquiring good grades. If this motivation is not gently guided, effective learning will be hampered.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ambrose et al. (2010, p.3), learning is \"a process that leads to change, which occurs as a result of experience and increases the potential for improved performance and future learning.\" Here, Ambrose\'s deliberation of learning seems to distinguish between being schooled and being educated.\r\n\r\nOne who claims to be educated is assumed to have learned and therefore is obligated to perform. But those pursuing grades or degrees could be schooled and passed through the walks of high school or college without realizing the impact of learning.\r\n\r\nHere are a few suggestions for your perusal and consideration, as I perceive learning as most profitable to obtaining mere grades or degrees:\r\n\r\n1. Learning informs you.\r\n\r\nStudents who concentrate on learning what the teacher teaches in class are often informed about the course or subject matter. Someone said, \'information brings transformation.\' In the same, whatever is learned is never wasted. One day, that knowledge will be needed to solve a problem.\r\n\r\n2. Learning empowers you.\r\n\r\nThrough learning, people acquire new knowledge which empowers or adds to their skills and abilities. Proper acquisition of knowledge fills a vacuum of ignorance in humans. For instance, if a student concentrates well on learning to solve a math problem, he or she will have confidence or boldness in exhibiting that mathematical skill. Indeed, students become trained and equipped by learning new ideas.\r\n\r\n3. Learning promotes you.\r\n\r\nLearning makes you more relevant than just earning grades or degrees. Your degree might promote you but not as long as you would expect. Sooner or later, people will begin to examine your academic performance instead. Although our degrees are required to place us in specific life statuses, they are independently reliable in some cases. Clan Jacobs said, \"Knowledge not shared is wasted.\" Imagine the promotion and impacts if you attempt to\r\napply knowledge appropriately.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, students must never prefer grades or degrees over learning. Being a student and teacher, I take this advice seriously as I desire to pursue higher education. To my students, classmates, and colleagues, let us study hard to make good grades and ultimately earn honorable degrees. Above all, let us pay attention to how we earn these rewards because one day, we shall be called upon to justify our educational status.\r\n'),

Tamba', '-respect-39573158.jpg', '        ONE WORD that is essential to relationships but not clearly defined and applied is respect. I have observed a high misconception about respect in our world.\r\n\r\nIn the book Love & Respect, Dr. Emerson Eggerichs (2004, p.4) categorically affirmed, “… Respect is, indeed, the missing piece of the puzzle” in many relationships. He emphasized that love is not enough to keep a relationship with people (Eggerichs, 2004).\r\n\r\nAs the demand for respect increases in families between husbands and wives and organizations between employers and employees, some parents and leaders seem to lack the ability to gain respect and deter a true example of respect.\r\n\r\nTen (10) years ago, I watched an Indian movie at the River lane Cinema on Broad Street in Monrovia. The move portrayed the fallacy of respect, which is evident today in families and organizations.\r\n\r\nIn the movie, the disrespected father wanted everyone to respect him, including his wife. Because his children were so afraid of him, they would behave whenever he was around. He thought he was highly respected and gloried in himself.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, something went wrong, and he discovered that his children did not respect him as he thought. He found they only feared his appearance but did not respect his personality. Indeed, he was deceived!\r\n\r\nThe scariest experience of life is to be made to believe something is true but later discover it is not. Like the case of this father, he probably lost confidence in his children and himself, too, for not discerning correctly.\r\n\r\nNowadays, imagine parents who distance themselves from their children and yet desire building relationships with them. They appear as authoritarians, thus creating fear in the children while demanding respect from them.\r\n\r\nEvery time these authoritarian people come home, the children are troubled and worried about the mistreatment they would receive but yet feel compared to embracing their parents. However, the parents term that as respect.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, autocratic bosses or employers would impose on their employees and demand respect but they are not willing to reciprocate same. These leaders often feel highly respected when they speak, and everyone is afraid to respond or even pose any questions.\r\n\r\nThey assume that respect is gained when employees become quiet and busy when they are around. Such leaders tend to object to almost every view from employees and strive to exercise dictator supremacy in stirring the affairs of their institutions. They want to receive respect at the disadvantage of others.\r\n\r\nIn the article, ‘Understanding Respect, ’ Alison Rasgado (2016, p.1) asserted, “Respect is something everyone wants to receive, but some people seem to have a hard time giving. Respect is something that must be earned, yet something many people think they are owed….The first step in being a more respectful person is being able to define respect and its application to self and others.”\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is respect? Jennifer Lowery (2017) stated, “Respect is a feeling of caring for someone’s well-being and can be shown by using good manners and demonstrating kindness.”\r\n\r\nLeape et al. (2012, p.854) noted, “The responsibility for creating a culture of respect falls on the organization’s leader because only he or she can set the tone and initiate the processes that will lead to change.”\r\n\r\nJeremy Brown (2019) disclosed, “When couples have respect, it frees them up to be their person, having their interests, opinions, and feelings without fear of rejection or reprisal from their partners.\r\n\r\nHere are five reflective and influential statements of respect drawn from these authors’ perspectives:\r\n\r\n1. Respect is not gained; it is earned.\r\n2. Respect is not being afraid of others; it is loving others.\r\n3. Respect is not fake humility; it is freedom from deceptive conscience.\r\n4. Respect is not always agreement; it is demonstrating unity in diversity.\r\n5. Respect begins with self and extends to others.\r\n\r\nParents and leaders must learn to understand the true meaning of genuine respect and apply it appropriately so that peace, love and unity will continue in their homes and organizations.

Tamba', 'inspiring_leaders.jpg', 'Leadership plays a significant role in the affairs of Christian organizations. However, many pastors and lay leaders are more preoccupied with position than service. In his essay, \'The Servant as a Leader,\' Robert K. Greenleaf indicated that those aspiring to leadership should become servants and leaders someday. Greenleaf (1996) coined the term \'servant leader.\' Nevertheless, the Christian servant leadership style is modeled after Jesus as illustrated in Mark 10:42-45. From this passage, the following lessons are captured and should be employed in churches and emulated by pastors and lay leaders: \r\n \r\n1. That the place of leadership in the church must be understood from Jesus\' perspective\r\n \r\nJesus understood leadership from a service perspective. The position does not make any leader more relevant than providing quality and sacrificial services that would speak louder than the leader would imagine. \r\n\r\n2. That pastors and lay leaders are to become servants physically or consciously before occupying a leadership position in the church.\r\n\r\nDesiring to serve before occupying a position demonstrates a faithful servant\'s heart as a leader. As Jesus decided that disciples become servants, those who want to become leaders must be humble to serve in the church that they might be qualified to occupy a position. \r\n \r\n3. Jesus adopted servant leadership to demonstrate services and humility to help impact the church.\r\n \r\nThroughout the ministry of Jesus, he portrayed a servant leadership style and supported it, thus encouraging his disciples to become servants of all. \r\n \r\n4. That Christian leaders are not rulers over their people.\r\n \r\nRulers are dictators. They lord over people and force them to do whatever they say. Here, Jesus strictly commanded the disciples, \"so shall it not be among you,\" to rule over people. \r\n \r\n5. That the terms servant and leader are paradoxical ideas to portray a true servant leader.\r\n \r\nParadoxically, those who are seeking church leadership should become servants. Both terminologies are contrasting ideas but can be understood as one concept and restructured as a servant leader; that is, becoming a leader is also becoming a servant, whereas becoming a servant does not necessarily mean one would become a leader but while serving the possibility might arise that such person may be called upon to lead. \r\n \r\n6. That position is not the only reason for aspiring to leadership.\r\n \r\nJesus negated the philosophical ideology of leadership that one must have a position before he can serve. This statement is the opposite of the true meaning of leadership as taught by Jesus in Mark 10:42-45. The position is not leadership. In his book, Five Levels of Leadership, John C. Maxwell (1993, p.3) asserted, \"Position is not the only level of leadership but productivity and relationship.\"\r\n \r\nIn light of the above implications, the Liberian Church must recapture the biblical mandate of leadership by giving heed to the teachings of Jesus as recorded in Mark 10:42-45. Jesus is a classic example of servant leadership. He humbled Himself to God and man regardless of His deity and divinity (Phi. 2:5-11). He demonstrated a humbled heart by washing His disciples\' feet (John 13), which shows that the primary goal of Jesus\' earthly ministry was service. Jesus came to serve rather than to be served (Mark 10:45).\r\n \r\nTherefore, pastors and lay leaders are servant leaders and not bosses to exercise authority or lordship over their people. They must learn to walk in humility, obedience, and sacrifice of others. Acquiring a position should not be their prerequisite to service. Instead, they must begin to serve in the church, for which their works may qualify them for leadership. \r\n \r\n     '),

Nowadays, the majority of Liberian pastors do not practice the life of spirituality, and it has prompted others to discredit the pastoral ministry and dishonor the call of a pastor.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sheldrake (2012), the word spirituality originated in Christianity with the Latin adjective spiritual, or spiritual, as this translates the Greek. The \'spiritual\' was originally not the opposite of \'bodily\' or \'physical.\' Instead, it was contrasted with \'fleshly,\' which meant worldly or contrary to God\'s Spirit. So the distinction was basically between two approaches to life. \r\n\r\nSpirituality should be the goal of a pastor\'s spiritual life. He or she should hunger for this goal in mind until the end of his or her Christian journey. Sheldrake (2012) asserted, \"…a weapon in the hand of God is a holy minister.\" Indeed, God has always been searching for holy men and women that will take on the world for Jesus. \r\n\r\nThe New Dawn Liberia (2016) reported a story of a 38-year-old pastor who allegedly raped a 12-year-old girl in his church office. With this lousy image of pastors, it is incumbent upon them to strive in every way possible to live a spiritual life. Why is it essential to live a spiritual life? Thompson (2014) emphasized that the spiritual life is the growing force by the stirring of the Holy Spirit in us. It is that moving emotion of the Holy Spirit in the human spirit which drives us into fellowship with God and creation. Therefore, God\'s message and the messenger must be the same—they cannot be separated. A pastor\'s spiritual life will draw people to Christ without preaching. \r\n\r\nPastors should cultivate spiritual characteristics such as faithful, peaceful, integrity, kindness, love, trust, self-control, patience, truth-telling, contentment, and commitment. These characteristics do not develop overnight; it requires spending more time in the word of God, praying and reading other spiritual books on spiritual characteristics. \r\n\r\nSpirituality within the church is often considered to be the pastors\' priority simply because they preach and teach the word of God. Society considers them Christ\'s representatives on earth, and their personal life cannot be separated from church life. As John R. Throop (2011) declares, to be formed spiritually means to engage in specific practices and disciplines with one clear goal: \"to draw nearer to God in Christ and so focus less and less on self\" (Throop, 2011). A \'spiritual person (for example, in I Corinthians 2:14-15) was simply someone who sought to live under the influence of God, whereas a \"fleshly\' (or worldly) person was concerned primarily with personal satisfaction, comfort, or success (Sheldrake, 2012).\r\n\r\nRoger S. Gottlieb (2012) defines spirituality in its broadest term \"as an understanding of how life should be lived and attempt to live that way; a spiritually oriented life gives rise to certain characteristic experiences, and certain characteristic experiences may prompt the adoption of a spiritual perspective and motivate a spiritually oriented life” (Gottfried, 2012). From the two definitions above, the central word is life, which indicates the individual involved. He/she must be willing to experience this spiritual change through the rapid development of their spirit. \r\n\r\nSpirituality is a valuable Christian characteristic of Christianity that pastors of Monrovia should seek to cultivate in their lives by living out the word of God through their deeds and actions.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, to those pastors of Monrovia who take for granted the spiritual life, the writer has presented the information with a spirit of love to help you change for the church\'s good. There is no such thing as knowing it all in God’s kingdom. We all learn new things all the time, and doing God’s work requires that we create room for improvement.  \r\n'),

Bribery is a form of corruption damaging the core of Liberian society\'s private and public sectors. \r\n\r\nUsually, in Liberian schools, students are extorted of funds illegally by their teachers who desire to enrich themselves at the detriment of these students’ inabilities or laziness to study their lessons. \r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, some government officials were charged with corruption and sanctioned in the public sector. The US secretary lamented that corruption has long been undermining Liberia\'s democracy and economy, thereby robbing the Liberian people of funds for public service. \r\n\r\nSince 1979 I have served and held many teaching positions both in private and public schools in Liberia. Between 1979 to 1988, Liberia could boast of an excellent educational system. Students worked independently, and teachers served with honor and integrity. \r\n\r\nI cannot record teachers in the act of bribery in those days. Students were responsible for their output. They studied harder to make uncompromised grades. However, when the war broke out between 1989-1990, infrastructures were destroyed, and people were killed. By the 1990s, the war subsided, and students resumed regular classes.\r\n\r\nNotably, from 2000 till now, I have been greatly disappointed by our educational system\'s corrupt structure and practice. I have observed a high rate of bribery undermining the educational system of Liberia, ranging from high school to college. \r\n\r\nAlieu Mohamed Kromah (2019) studied a case of corruption in private schools in Liberia. He further revealed that teachers are considered the prominent participants in the act of corruption because of the lack of accountability process in the schools.\r\n\r\nMost female students experience molestation whenever they cannot afford the required amount to bribe their male teachers. Students are no longer studying because they are looking for money that they will give to their teachers for grades. A student asked why I must spend sleepless nights studying and doing assignments when other students will only give money to the teacher and are given higher grades than us, who spend our time burning the midnight candle. \r\n\r\nJames 3:1 declares, “not many of you should be teachers because teachers will be judged more strictly\" (New international version). This verse indicates that teaching is a profession and should be considered a call to serve both God and humanity because the judgment of accountability awaits how teachers serve as stewards. Religious teachers must adhere to this warning. Alternatively, if any teacher is caught practicing corruption, he or she must be persecuted according to the Law of Liberia. \r\n\r\nBribery is rampant in many Liberian schools. The Ministry of Education and School administrations are not regularly checking on the performance of teachers and students. Let it be known that teachers are the ambassadors of the Ministry of Education and the Liberian government, and they need to strive for excellence by improving their behaviors and attitudes toward the teaching profession.\r\n\r\nTherefore, teachers must learn to do the right thing by saying NO to corruption. Corruption is not for government officials alone; it is for everyone and every citizen serving. School administrators must be very robust and proactive in supervision. The Ministry of Education also needs to enforce the regular visitations of District Education Officers (DEOs) to schools to promote active supervision of teachers’ performance and students’ learning environment. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, to minimize or eliminate corruption in Liberian schools, teachers\' salaries should be increased according to their qualifications. Teachers assigned in various counties should be given high incentives that will motivate them to stay on the job despite the challenges of the rural communities. \r\n\r\nI look forward to students not having to bribe their way to school. A day that students will study and be able to defend their academic achievements adequately.\r\n    '),

Fomgbeh', 'messy-education-image.jpg', 'Since Liberia\'s former President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf emphatically disclosed that Liberia\'s education system is a big messy, most Liberians have become observant and have found out that “Many students are acquiring unmerited grades in exchange of sex and money”; what could be the cause of these unwholesome behaviors; and who is responsible?\r\n\r\nShould the parents (guardians), students, school administrators, teachers, or the national government be responsible? I firmly believe everyone should be responsible for the messy educational system in Liberia. Each person or institution has negatively contributed to the underperformance of Liberian students.\r\n\r\nFirst, many parents are working hard to raise money for education but do not spend time monitoring what they are spending money towards. They must exhibit the attitude of checking their pupils\' lesson notes, assignments, and the extra curriculum activities. Do parents and guardians even care to inquire about the learning activities of the pupils?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most parents do not see the need to help the students learn but prefer to pay money for their child/children to be promoted. Parents\' involvement in the learning process of the child/children at home and during school hours is one key factor that shows the students will perform academically in and out of school.\r\n\r\nSecond, many school administrators are poorly operating schools. They have no passion for quality education but rather treat it as a lucrative business investment where they would maximize profit and minimize the cost to the detriment of the students\' outputs. School administrators are yet to comply with the requirements of forming schools. \r\n\r\nAccording to the approved Education Act of Liberia (2011), chapter (6) six, section one (1) states that “all school administrators should be eligible to hold position, Elementary school administrator must be a “C” certificate in the area of Education, while Junior high school administrator will be in the area of “B” certificate, and Senior high school administrators must hold a bachelor’s degree in education or its equivalent an “A” certificate all from a recognized school of Education.”\r\n\r\nSchool administrators accept bribes to compromise the education standard in our country. It is frustrating as I observe teachers supplying grades for either sex or money. This act is not helpful for the future of Liberia and those students involved.\r\n\r\nThird, many school teachers are contributing highly to the deficiency of Liberian students. 88% of our Liberia teachers are in the wrong and guilty of the facts for receiving money or sex to give students grades in school. I perceive that all teachers that enter the classroom to teach pupils are second parents to their students; so, it is unprofessional to receive bribes (in the form of sex or money) for grades.\r\n\r\nFourth, students, too, should be responsible for their poor performance in school. Why if they are not willing to learn or to take instructions from their teachers? Then it would become difficult for them to learn. They would use their bodies, especially for female students, and most often, male students use their money to undermine the education system by acquiring unmerited grades.\r\n\r\nLastly, I think the Government of Liberia has a considerable share in this problem. The government\'s responsibility is to educate its citizens, be it small or big, but why is it not happening in the Government of Liberia? Some school authorities sell school materials that should be intended for free distribution. Where are the subsidies given to private and faith-based schools in Liberia? \r\n\r\nMost Liberians feel comfortable sending their child/children to public school, but because of poverty, they cannot afford it. The Ministry of Education carries out no regular monitoring and evaluation through their DEOs and CEOs to ensure Liberia’s education system is restored from \"mess to best,\" as promised by our Former President, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the current issue, “sex and money for grades,\" undermines the quality of Education in Liberia. I am convinced that no one is exempted from this problem. Parents (guardians), school administrators, teachers, students, and the Government of Liberia should be responsible for the messy educational system in Liberia. Parents should be actively involved in their child/children\'s education; teachers and students must desist from bribery and the Liberian Government must promote equal and quality education by increasing regular monitoring and supervision at various school campuses in Liberia.');

(67, 'November-05-2022 19:56:49', 'Pros and Cons of Commercial Bike Riding by Youth in Liberia', 'Education', 'Alveria Morris-Raynes', 'bike-riding-in-monrovia.jpg', 'When I leave my house almost every morning, I am at peace until I hit the pavement towards Monrovia (capital city of Liberia). What I see disturbs me more and more each day as I drive trying to get to my destination without hitting moving bikes that come directly towards me without fear that my car could hit and harm its passengers. This excessive defensive driving continues until I reach my destination.\r\n\r\nThese bikes are driven mostly by young men that others describe as vulnerable because they do not have skills and education that will help them in adulthood. Furthermore, they believe in making fast cash which exposes them to accidents that leave them most times injured or dead. They endanger the lives of their passengers and oftentimes cause damage to vehicles in the traffic. They are also highly vulnerable to exploitation and their impatience to accumulate selfish wealth put them at risk in the traffic. \r\n\r\nSome Adults who should be advising these young people sometimes try to justify why they think they should be running after money and not in school trying to secure a better future for themselves and our Country Liberia. Sometimes I get angry with them; however, most of those who try to justify are either people who also did not take advantage of the opportunities they had to develop themselves by learning something that would have made their lives and our country better or people who are benefiting from the ignorance of these youth to promote their political ambition.\r\n\r\nIn Liberia, a youth is anyone between the ages of 15-35 years of age. According to UNESCO 2017 report, Liberia has a youthful population in that over 50% fall within this age group. With such youthful population one would think that they should be encouraged to acquire knowledge to help build Liberia instead of importing more bikes and employing them to be drivers of these killing machines.  I can’t help but wonder what Liberia will look like twenty (20) years from now if these young people are allowed to grow into adulthood with these unlawful and unethical behavior. \r\n\r\nMany of them have also dropped out of school believing that going to school is a waste of time when one can make money from riding bike. Most of them no matter how young, also have kids by girls within their age group who also see these guys as a means of survival. As long as they can meet their immediate daily needs, they are satisfied with life. They do not realize that it is possible for them to have a better and more secured life if only they can submit themselves to acquiring knowledge and skills that will last them through their old age. \r\n\r\nLiberia is experiencing this level of lawlessness because most of these young people were born to parents who were not de-traumatized or properly processed through the demobilization, disarmament and reintegration program (DDR) after the civil war in Liberia. Subsequently, in my opinion these negative moral and unethical behavior were passed on to the children within these families and communities thereby bringing us to where we are today with so much lawlessness amongst the bike riders. Another reason is that most of them are products of single parents (who were children themselves when they had them) who had to go out leaving them to fend for themselves in the communities.\r\n\r\nHowever, amid this lawlessness committed by bike riders, the Government of Liberia is responsible for being lenient in executing its judiciary duties. Those responsible for law and order are not enforcing the traffic laws when it comes to motorcyclist because of reasons best known to themselves. \r\n\r\nWhere there is no law, people must expect the breakdown of order. The bike riders do not respect the traffic rules. It is like it does not apply to them and the traffic rules are only meant for those driving vehicles. What makes it even worst is the fact that they hate to be corrected even if what someone tries to tell them is for their safety.\r\n\r\nDon’t get me wrong, commercial bikes also have some benefits. They take people where commercial vehicles refuse to take them. It also is a means of income for those operating them; nevertheless, it should be operated by mature adults with proper systems put into place for security and safety for all actors (operators, passengers and other vehicles operators).\r\n\r\nThis problem can be controlled if the use of bikes for commercial purpose is more organized in terms restriction of their movement to certain areas in the city; licenses and identifications must be mandatory for all operators and the enforcement of traffic laws should be prioritized. There must also be a cut of point in the importation of bikes to control the congestion of the traffic.  Commercial bike riders must also be above 21 years age. \r\n\r\nIf I may retrospect, Liberians experienced the benefits of the restriction of the movement of Bikes to certain areas; they were allowed to run mostly within the communities on the outskirts of Monrovia. At that time, we saw the free movement of vehicles in Monrovia and there was a drop in the accident rate. Also, when they are licensed for proper identifications, it will be easier to enforce the traffic laws and punished those who break them. \r\n\r\nThe appropriate traffic law regulators must also be equipped and exercise the willpower to enforce the laws without fear or favor.  Allowing children to run commercial bikes is an abuse of their rights to protection and education. The Government of Liberia must take actions to save our future generation, train and equip them to be law-abiding citizens. By putting these measures into place our traffic will be more organized, more lives will be saved and some of our young men will find their way back to school where they can become more productive citizens in the future.\r\n'),
(70, 'November-13-2022 03:09:20', 'The Impacts of Social Media on the Liberian Society', 'Social Media', 'F. Steven Miller, Jr. ', 'social-media-impacts.jpg', 'Social media has now become a platform for most of the information sharing in Liberia, unlike in the late 2000s; some print media outlets have also lost some of their audience due to the introduction of social media, and people who have not been communicating can now connect on this unique platform.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, social media has both positive and negative impacts, of which we must be aware of its negative influences on Liberian Society. Social media has more positive than negative impacts because its benefits are increasingly evident. \r\n\r\nAdults are creating a hostile environment for themselves through social media with hateful, personal, antagonistic, and political messages. Some annoying and misleading information is being disseminated through social media and is denigrating and immorally damaging in the form of pornographic images or videos, child molestation, and harassment, among others.\r\n\r\nUnlike Liberia, other countries like China restrict and monitor exchanges on social media. Security measures are taken to reduce the dissemination of fabricated information or prevent national threats. The Liberian experience with social media is apathy. Young or older people seem to abuse freedom of speech and dispel hateful messages that could foster gross instigation and impede national peace. \r\n\r\nIn cases where most Sierra Leoneans use WhatsApp as convenient for social media, and Americans use Instagram, Liberians often use Facebook and Messenger for social interaction. Most Liberians’ Facebook accounts were created without email addresses except contact numbers. \r\n\r\nMany students are obsessed with and knowledgeable about Facebook. However, they need to be more knowledgeable about using a browser like Google, Firefox, Opera, etc., to conduct research for their assignments as required by their instructors. Posting photos sometimes without written descriptions of the events makes it boring to read posts on Facebook. \r\n\r\nSocial media is also being used to spread false allegations and misleading information that would cause national chaos or disasters. It reduces our kids\' appetite for real change in their academic work. For instance, some students would be involved in academic malpractice by transferring exam information through messengers to their colleagues. This malpractice is continually observed because some kids would spend more time on social media than studying their notes. \r\n\r\nThe positive impacts of social media on Liberian Society are very essential. Social media can educate a whole society, and Liberia is no exception. School administrators have set up accounts to host online classes virtually between their teachers/professors and students. We cannot afford to miss online learning but to connect and experience the amazement of technology. \r\n\r\nSocial media value goes beyond the classroom. This interactive-based or oriented platform can simultaneously connect one person or more to the entire world. It can also connect people from all walks of life despite their religious, social, economic, cultural, and continental affiliations. It is becoming increasingly clear that social networks have become part of people’s lives. Electronic devices such phones and computers are easily owned. Liberians cannot go without them because of some considerate level of improvements in people\'s lives. \r\n\r\nSocial media has helped most Liberians reunite with one another at home and abroad despite the acute or poor network operations from our internet providers. It enhances the propagation of the word of God throughout regions despite geographical limitations. \r\n\r\nCovid-19, despite its negative effects, introduced the significance of social media to religious leaders, teachers, and entrepreneurs. Many new social media accounts were created, and holders aimed at conveying their messages to a larger audience. Interestingly, Liberian entrepreneurs are investigating online digital businesses, increasing customers, sales and profits for sustainability.  We cannot communicate extensively and progress effectively without social media. \r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, learn more about social media and take advantage of its negative implications to overcome our ignorance. Social media has some untold dangerous consequences, although it is one of the most reliable, efficient, and effective ways of communication. The Liberian Society seems to lack the capacity to restrict, and monitor the inappropriate usage of social media, as it continues to influence the younger generation negatively. We cannot dismiss it, though; we can put it under control to enjoy the positive aspects and eliminate its negativities.');
